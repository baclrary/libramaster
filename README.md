# LibraMaster ðŸ“š


Welcome to the Django Library Project! This project was conceived and developed during my studies at SoftServe Academy, as part of the coursework to gain real-world experience. Our main objective is to simplify the management of a library through a robust, intuitive, and user-friendly web application.

The project was developed in a team, however, the old GitHub repository may be removed soon by our organisation. The models were written by our mentors, and everything else was done by our team. It has been a long time, and I can now see what can be changed and improved. If there is a request, I will refactor this project.
